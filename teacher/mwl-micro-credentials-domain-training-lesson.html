						<h2>Growth Potential</h2>
						<p>Growth is to increase in size or maturity across time. It can be seen when watching a seed
							develop into a tree, or looking at pictures of when you were an infant to now. In general,
							everything that is alive, has a natural tendencey to grow.</p>

						<h2>Potential</h2>
						<p>Potential is the possibility of something happening when a person shows effort. Similar to
							Growth, people have some level of Potential to accomplish goals and tasks. Based upon
							certain
							conditions such as strength, timing, mood, and reflexes, a person may have a high  Potential
							of
							hitting a home-run.</p>

					<div class="less-details-in">
						<p>So, when Growth and Potential are combined, we get **Growth Potential**. This terms is
							defined as
							the possibility of a person to mature, or accomplish goals and tasks under certain
							conditions.
						</p>
						<p>Reaching your fullest Potential is being the _best version of yourself_. This is never easy!
							You
							must be willing to do things that are outside of your comfort zone. Some people are too
							intimidated by struggles they must face to grow. Other people don’t put forth the effort to
							grow, because they have a history of failing, or not getting what they desire. In order to
							become the _best version of yourself_, you must find Courage.</p>
						<p>Let’s take a look at two concepts that are closely linked to Growth Potential.</p>
					</div>
					<hr>
					<div class="less-details-in">
						<h2>Base</h2>
						<p>Base is the starting point, origin, or bottom of something. When this term is applied to
							people,
							it represents the beginning or what’s normal for them. For example, people might have a Base
							of
							getting a C on a paper, having few friends, or having minimal playing time in a sport.</p>

						<h2>Ideal</h2>
						<p>Ideal is what a person wants to happen. It shows a person has a desire for change,

							a
							paper, have many friends, or playing the majority of time in a sport.</p>
